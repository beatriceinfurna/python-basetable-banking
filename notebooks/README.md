# Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook used for the data preparation and exploratory analysis of the project.

The notebook documents the full workflow starting from the raw relational tables and ending with the construction of the final base table used for analysis and reporting.

## Contents

- **01_basetable_creation.ipynb**  
  This notebook performs the following steps:
  - Loading the raw banking tables (accounts, clients, transactions, loans, cards, etc.)
  - Cleaning and preprocessing the data
  - Aggregating transactional and account-level information
  - Engineering features at the client level
  - Creating the final base table used for exploratory analysis and reporting

The notebook is structured sequentially to clearly reflect the data processing pipeline.

## Reproducibility Notes

- The notebook uses **relative paths** to load data from the `data/` folder.
- The `data/processed/` folder contains the final base table generated by this notebook.
- Running the notebook from start to finish reproduces the processed dataset, assuming the raw data are available locally.

## How to Use This Notebook

1. Download the raw dataset from the source link provided above  
2. Place the raw files in the appropriate `data/` directory  
3. Run `01_basetable_creation.ipynb` from top to bottom  
4. Use the resulting base table for further analysis and reporting

This notebook is intended to complement the final report and visualizations by providing full transparency on the data preparation process.
